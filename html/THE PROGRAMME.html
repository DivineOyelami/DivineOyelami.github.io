    <h1> The Positions</h1>
    There are three positions you can apply for at a Camp in Canada.
    They are general camp counselor, activities camp counselor and support staff.
    While the counselor positions are the most popular and have you working closely with the children, a
    ll positions need you to be highly energetic and outgoing.
    Theses positions are great opportunities to boost your skills,
    add international work to your CV and to immerse yourself in the Canadian culture.
  </P>
  <p>
    <h1>The Application Process</h1>
    Applying to Camp Canada is quite simple and throughout the process we are there to help you through.
    If you have any questions along the way one of our staff members are always ready and willing to answer them.
  </P>
  <P>
    <h1>Stage One: Application and Interview</h1>
    To apply to the programme you’ll need to make the first stage payment for £69,
    this shows commitment to the programme and covers the cost of the interview..
    Once this payment is made, you’ll receive an application.
    After you have complete your application and returned it back to the team,
    we’ll review your application and, if you are a rockstar on paper,
    invite you to do an interview with either a member of staff or your local campus manager.
    These interviews are informal, but informative meetings that allow us to get to know you
    and your skills better so that we can ensure you have the strongest application possible
    and that we have the correct information about you to match you up with the right camp.
  </p>
  <P>
    <h1>Stage Two: Documentation</h1>
    Once the interview is done you will have 14 days to submit the rest of your application,
    3 references and a short application video. This is how the Camp Directors in Canada will get to know
    what kind of person you are on a personal level so make sure you talk about your skills in your video
    and include a few photos of you doing them. The references cannot be from friends or family members
    and must contain active contact details so we can verify them. Teachers, employers or coaches are the best references to fill out the forms.
  </P>
